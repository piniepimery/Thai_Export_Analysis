### The Challenge

In today's economic climate, loan demand is high, but the financial health of many businesses is weak. The challenge is no longer just finding businesses that *want* to borrow, but identifying those that *can reliably repay* to mitigate the risk of Non-Performing Loans (NPLs).

### The Solution

This model was built to shift the focus from "lending to whoever asks" to "strategically targeting sectors with a proven ability to repay." By analyzing historical data, the model achieves this by:

1.  **Distinguishing sustainable, long-term growth** from volatile, short-term spikes.
2.  **Identifying industries whose stable performance** indicates a stronger capacity to service debt.
3.  **Enabling lenders to proactively target these high-quality segments,** thereby minimizing the risk of future bad debt.
